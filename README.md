# fdh.pw Link Tree adapted

This is a clone of the app Linktree made with HTML and CSS. It has the following items:
- A profile picture
- Profile name
- Links
- Logo 

To add more links just change the javascript section at the end in [index.html](https://github.com/fdiengdoh/fdiengdoh.github.io/blob/main/index.html). Find the following code block:

<code>
  //Add New links here check Readme file for details
        var links = [
</code>

Then add the following line

<code>
  {link:"New Link Here", title:"Title of the link"},
</code>

Your new link is updated
